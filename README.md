# Life After Dev
## A social media site for DevPoint Labs alumni

This is an application that allows DevPoint Labs alumni to find each other, make connections, and also collaborate on projects together.
The app is my final project I graduated with for the DevPoint Labs web development bootcamp.

## Steps to setup and run
1. `git clone git@github.com:jimibue/react-rails-semantic-starter.git` CHANGE THIS TO YOUR REPO
2. `cd project-name`
3. `bundle install`
4. in database.yml change name of database `what_ever_you_named_your_start_project` to **project-name**
5. `rails db:create db:migrate db:seed`
6. `rails s -p 3001`
7. `cd client && yarn`
8. `yarn start`
### handle git
1.  - remove origin `git remote rm origin`
    - git add remote origin to new repo
